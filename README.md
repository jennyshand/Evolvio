# Evolvio
Web app designed to interact with a database I made to keep track of in game logistics and play for a fictional game scenario called "Evolvio" which would play similarly to the real life game "Spore" by Maxis. Allows the user to examine how many of a chosen creature type currently exist within a chosen environment within the game, examine what effect a chosen food will have on a chosen creature type, and add a chosen food type to a chosen environment.
