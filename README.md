# Evolvio
Web app designed to interact with a database I made to keep track of in game logistics and play for a fictional game scenario called "Evolvio" which would play similarly to the real life game "Spore" by Maxis. Allows the user to examine how many of a chosen creature type currently exist within a chosen environment within the game, examine what effect a chosen food will have on a chosen creature type, and add a chosen food type to a chosen environment.

This can be run at: http://nrs-projects.humboldt.edu/~jes1098/328hw12/custom-session.php. Although it requires a valid HSU username and password to access the Oracle database.
